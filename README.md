# A Semaphore demo CI/CD pipeline using Docker based Python / Flask / MongoDB application.

[![Build Status](https://semaphore-demos.semaphoreci.com/badges/semaphore-demo-python-flask/branches/master.svg)](https://semaphore-demos.semaphoreci.com/projects/semaphore-demo-python-flask)

Example of Docker based, Python Flask MongoDB application and CI/CD pipeline for integrating it with Semaphore 2.0. This application demonstrates CRUD operations using Flask and MongoDB as database. It also includes UI for all CRUD views.

   cd <project directory>
   sem init
   ```

Install [SEM CLI](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/53-sem-reference#download-and-install) into your local

Create your Docker credential file using metadata name as pyflask-semaphore and encrypt it with SEM CLI tool that is installed in previous step [How To](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/66-environment-variables-and-secrets)

Once everything will setup appropriately as descibed in above steps, The CI pipeline will look like this:
